# Berry-Harvesting-Rover
A rover bot that utilizes computer vision and a robotic arm to detect and harvest berries based on various parameters like size and colour. 

# Motivation Behind The Project
[Urban farming](https://www.thespruceeats.com/what-is-urban-farming-5188341) is a new concept that aims to utilize rooftops of apartments and similar small spaces in a city/heavily populated region to grow small plants while also expending minimum effort. For this purpose, generally smaller and more resilient plants are chosen. For this purpose, various forms of berry-type fruits such a blackberries, tomatoes, eggplants, etc. are ideal due to their small size. 

In urban farming, it is possible to automate many things, including watering of plants as well as pest control. However, automated harvesting has always been a challenge, since in berry-type plants different individual fruits ripen at different times. Hence, for this purpose, a rover capable of using computer vision to differentiate between ripened and unripened fruits is of great use.
